# AlgorithmicTrading-ML-capstone-Udacity
algorithmic trading using machine learning and deep learning algorithms

This project constructs an algorithmic trading system using Python libraries including  Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
It is a real-time system which is able to process streaming financial data. Specifically, it connects to the Oanda platform for Forex trading.
Moreover, event-based backtesting is provided. In addition, severy machine learning and deep learning algorithms are used to predict market 
movement directions as well as market prices. Then trading strategies use these predictions to generate transaction signals to produce alpha 
profits. Finally, performance analysis is conducted. Please notice that this project can be directly used for real trading. So use and modify 
it at your own risk. The author will not be responsible for any losses in your real trading based on the content of this project.
