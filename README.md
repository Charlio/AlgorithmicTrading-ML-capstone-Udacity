# AlgorithmicTrading-ML-capstone-Udacity
algorithmic trading using machine learning and deep learning algorithms (capstone project of Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - Udacity)

This project construct an algorithmic trading system using Python libraries including  Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
It is a real-time system which is able to process streaming financial data. Specifically, it connects to the Oanda platform for Forex trading.
event-based backtesting is provided. Severy machine learning and deep learning algorithms are used to predict market movement directions as
well as market prices. Then trading strategies use these predictions to generate transaction signals to produce alpha profits. Finally, 
performance analysis is conducted. This project can be directly used for real trading. So use and modify it at your own risk!
